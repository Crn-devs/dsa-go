    "\n",
    "the main reason for needing **Big O** is to evaluate an algorithms time and space complexity, this is essentially how much time or memory an algorithm will take or use for a given operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "so why not use **time** ?\n",

    "time is a good introductory indicator of an algorithms run-time or time complexity however its not a reliable measure for computation due to the following reasons\n",

    "3. given an algorithm that runs very quickly time may not be a precise enough measure \n"
